 # Project Description
The system captures sign language movements using a camera or video input, analyzes keypoints and gestures with deep learning models (such as CNNs and Transformers), and translates them into understandable text or speech on the spot.​

It supports communication between deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals and those who do not know sign language, making everyday conversations, public announcements, and emergency alerts more accessible.​

The architecture emphasizes inclusivity, scalability, and modularity, allowing deployment on multiple platforms (mobile, web, embedded systems).​

Common features include gesture recognition, facial expression analysis, natural language generation, and integration with cloud or local databases for improved accuracy and speed.
